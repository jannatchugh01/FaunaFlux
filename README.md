This project aims to develop a comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Platform using Vultr's cloud infrastructure, designed to monitor, analyse, and protect biodiversity in real-time. The platform integrates advanced technologies such as IoT devices, machine learning, and data analytics to provide valuable insights into wildlife populations, habitats, and threats. The primary goal is to support conservation efforts by offering a robust solution for researchers, environmentalists, and policymakers to track critical wildlife data and optimize conservation strategies.
Key Features:
•	Wildlife Population Metrics: Tracks species populations and movements using IoT sensors and real-time data processing.
•	Behavioural Analysis: AI monitors wildlife behaviour, enabling deeper insights into species adaptation.
•	Species Extinction Alert: Provides early warnings to prevent species extinction with actionable data.
•	Community Engagement Metrics: Encourages collaboration between conservationists and local communities.
•	Climate Change Impact: Assesses the effect of climate changes on ecosystems and wildlife populations.
